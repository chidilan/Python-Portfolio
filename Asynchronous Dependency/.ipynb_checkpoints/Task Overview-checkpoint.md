# **Asynchronous Dependency Injection Framework**

This code builds an **async-first dependency injection system** using **metaclasses, descriptors, decorators, and async/await patterns**. It allows services to be dynamically injected, supporting **lazy evaluation**, **caching**, and **async service resolution**.

### **Key Complexity Factors**
- **Metaclasses** control class creation and inject dependencies at runtime.
- **Descriptors** manage async service access with caching and lazy evaluation.
- **Decorators** register services and control dependency injection logic.
- **Asynchronous Execution** ensures async dependencies are properly awaited.

### **Code:**

```python
import asyncio
from functools import wraps


class AsyncDependencyDescriptor:
    """Descriptor for handling async dependency injection with caching."""
    
    def __init__(self, service_name):
        self.service_name = service_name
        self.cache = {}

    async def resolve(self, instance):
        """Resolve the dependency asynchronously (caching results)."""
        if instance not in self.cache:
            service_factory = instance.__class__.get_dependency(self.service_name)
            if asyncio.iscoroutinefunction(service_factory):
                self.cache[instance] = await service_factory()
            else:
                self.cache[instance] = service_factory()
        return self.cache[instance]

    def __get__(self, instance, owner):
        if instance is None:
            return self  # Class-level access returns the descriptor itself
        return self.resolve(instance)  # Return coroutine


class AsyncMeta(type):
    """Metaclass that manages async dependencies dynamically."""

    _dependencies = {}

    def __new__(mcs, name, bases, namespace):
        # Identify dependency descriptors and attach them
        for attr, value in namespace.items():
            if isinstance(value, AsyncDependencyDescriptor):
                value.service_name = attr
        cls = super().__new__(mcs, name, bases, namespace)
        return cls

    def register_dependency(cls, name, factory):
        """Register a dependency factory (sync or async)."""
        cls._dependencies[name] = factory

    def get_dependency(cls, name):
        """Retrieve a registered dependency factory."""
        return cls._dependencies.get(name)


def inject_dependency(name):
    """Decorator for registering dependency factories."""
    def wrapper(func):
        AsyncMeta.register_dependency(name, func)
        return func
    return wrapper


class AsyncServiceBase(metaclass=AsyncMeta):
    """Base class for async services with dependency injection."""
    pass


# --- Example Usage ---

@inject_dependency("database")
async def create_database_connection():
    """Mock async database connection creation."""
    await asyncio.sleep(1)  # Simulate async setup
    return "DB Connection Established"


@inject_dependency("cache")
def create_cache_service():
    """Mock sync cache service."""
    return "Cache Service Ready"


class MyApp(AsyncServiceBase):
    db = AsyncDependencyDescriptor("database")
    cache = AsyncDependencyDescriptor("cache")

    async def run(self):
        """Simulate app execution using injected dependencies."""
        db_conn = await self.db  # Await async dependency resolution
        cache_service = await self.cache  # Cache service is sync, but still awaited
        print(f"Using {db_conn} and {cache_service}")


# --- Running the Example ---
async def main():
    app = MyApp()
    await app.run()

asyncio.run(main())
```

## **Why This is Complex (Even in its Simplified Form)**

### **1. Metaclasses for Dynamic Class Behavior**
- **`AsyncMeta`** dynamically registers and retrieves dependency factories.
- This means **services are injected automatically** into classes inheriting from `AsyncServiceBase`.

### **2. Descriptors for Lazy Dependency Resolution**
- `AsyncDependencyDescriptor` acts as a **lazy resolver**, preventing unnecessary instantiation.
- Dependencies **arenâ€™t created until accessed**, reducing startup overhead.

### **3. Decorators for Dependency Registration**
- `@inject_dependency("database")` dynamically registers async/sync factories.
- This separates **business logic from service creation**.

### **4. Asynchronous Programming Complexity**
- Dependencies **may be async or sync**, so the resolution process must handle both cases.
- `async def resolve(self, instance)` determines whether to `await` the service.

### **5. Runtime Service Injection and Caching**
- Services are resolved **only once per instance** and stored in `self.cache`.
- Supports **multiple instances of services**, similar to **singleton and factory patterns**.

---

## **Practical Applications**
- **Web Frameworks**: Managing async database sessions, caches, and API clients.
- **AI Pipelines**: Dynamically injecting pre-trained models or ML preprocessing steps.
- **Microservices**: Managing distributed service communication.

---

## **Trade-offs & Considerations**
- **Flexibility vs. Complexity**: Powerful but can be **over-engineered** for small projects.
- **Debugging Overhead**: Async metaclasses can make **stack traces harder to follow**.
- **Performance**: Introduces **lazy evaluation**, which is great for optimization but may lead to **unexpected delays**.

---

## **Conclusion**
This example showcases **metaprogramming, async logic, decorators, and dependency injection**, mirroring advanced techniques used in **real-world scalable applications**. **While elegant, itâ€™s a double-edged sword**, requiring **deep understanding** for maintenance and debugging.

Would you like to extend this further, maybe adding **middleware**, **event-driven hooks**, or **custom logging for debugging async flows**? ðŸš€

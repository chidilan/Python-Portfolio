    "## **Why This is Complex (Even in its Simplified Form)**\n",
    "\n",
    "### **1. Metaclasses for Dynamic Class Behavior**\n",
    "\n",
    "-   **`AsyncMeta`** dynamically registers and retrieves dependency\n",
    "    factories.\n",
    "-   This means **services are injected automatically** into classes\n",
    "    inheriting from `AsyncServiceBase`.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **2. Descriptors for Lazy Dependency Resolution**\n",
    "\n",
    "-   `AsyncDependencyDescriptor` acts as a **lazy resolver**, preventing\n",
    "    unnecessary instantiation.\n",
    "-   Dependencies **aren’t created until accessed**, reducing startup\n",
    "    overhead.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **3. Decorators for Dependency Registration**\n",
    "\n",
    "-   `@inject_dependency(\"database\")` dynamically registers async/sync\n",
    "    factories.\n",
    "-   This separates **business logic from service creation**.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **4. Asynchronous Programming Complexity**\n",
    "\n",
    "-   Dependencies **may be async or sync**, so the resolution process\n",
    "    must handle both cases.\n",
    "-   `async def resolve(self, instance)` determines whether to `await`\n",
    "    the service.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **5. Runtime Service Injection and Caching**\n",
    "\n",
    "-   Services are resolved **only once per instance** and stored in\n",
    "    `self.cache`.\n",
    "-   Supports **multiple instances of services**, similar to **singleton\n",
    "    and factory patterns**.\n",
    "\n",
    "------------------------------------------------------------------------\n",
    "\n",
    "## **Practical Applications**\n",
    "\n",
    "-   **Web Frameworks**: Managing async database sessions, caches, and\n",
    "    API clients.\n",
    "-   **AI Pipelines**: Dynamically injecting pre-trained models or ML\n",
    "    preprocessing steps.\n",
    "-   **Microservices**: Managing distributed service communication.\n",
    "\n",
    "------------------------------------------------------------------------\n",
    "\n",
    "## **Trade-offs & Considerations**\n",
    "\n",
    "-   **Flexibility vs. Complexity**: Powerful but can be\n",
    "    **over-engineered** for small projects.\n",
    "-   **Debugging Overhead**: Async metaclasses can make **stack traces\n",
    "    harder to follow**.\n",
    "-   **Performance**: Introduces **lazy evaluation**, which is great for\n",
    "    optimization but may lead to **unexpected delays**.\n",
    "\n",
    "------------------------------------------------------------------------\n",
    "\n",
    "## **Conclusion**\n",
    "\n",
    "This example showcases **metaprogramming, async logic, decorators, and\n",
    "dependency injection**, mirroring advanced techniques used in\n",
    "**real-world scalable applications**. **While elegant, it’s a\n",
    "double-edged sword**, requiring **deep understanding** for maintenance\n",
    "and debugging."

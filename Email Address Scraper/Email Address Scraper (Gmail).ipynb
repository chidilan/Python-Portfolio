    "## Understanding the Imports\n",
    "\n",
    "**Purpose:** This code imports necessary libraries for interacting with email, handling data, and performing text manipulation.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Imported Libraries:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **imaplib:** Used for interacting with IMAP email servers. This library allows you to connect to an email account, search for emails, and retrieve email data.\n",
    "* **email:** Provides tools for parsing and handling email messages. It helps in extracting information like sender, recipient, subject, and message content from emails.\n",
    "* **email.header:** Specifically used for decoding email headers, which might contain encoded characters or special formatting.\n",

    "## Loading Credentials\n",
    "\n",
    "### Purpose:\n",
    "This code block loads credentials for accessing an email account from a YAML file.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Steps:\n",
    "1. **Import necessary library:**\n",
    "   * `import yaml`: Imports the YAML library for loading configuration data from a YAML file.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Specify credentials file path:**\n",
    "   * `credentials_path = r\"C:\\Users\\ASUS\\OneDrive\\Pictures\\credentials Manufacturing.yml\"`: Sets the path to the YAML file containing the credentials. The `r` prefix indicates a raw string, preventing potential escape sequence issues.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Open the credentials file:**\n",
    "   * `with open(credentials_path) as f:`: Opens the specified YAML file in read mode using a `with` statement, ensuring proper file closure even in case of exceptions.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Load YAML content:**\n",
    "   * `my_credentials = yaml.load(f, Loader=yaml.FullLoader)`: Loads the contents of the YAML file into the `my_credentials` dictionary using the `yaml.load` function. The `Loader=yaml.FullLoader` argument is essential for safely loading YAML data.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Extract user and password:**\n",
    "   * `user, password = my_credentials[\"user\"], my_credentials[\"password\"]`: Extracts the `user` and `password` values from the loaded YAML data and assigns them to respective variables.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Assumptions:\n",
    "* The YAML file (`credentials Manufacturing.yml`) is located at the specified path and contains a dictionary with keys `user` and `password`.\n",
    "* The values for `user` and `password` are valid credentials for an email account.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Potential Improvements:\n",
    "* **Error handling:** Consider adding error handling to gracefully handle cases where the file doesn't exist, is inaccessible, or the YAML content is malformed.\n",
    "* **Security:** For production environments, storing credentials in plain text YAML files is generally not recommended. Consider using encrypted storage or environment variables.\n",
    "* **Code clarity:** Using more descriptive variable names like `credentials_file_path` instead of `credentials_path` can improve code readability."

    "\n",
    "### Code Explanation:\n",
    "\n",
    "This code establishes a connection to the Gmail IMAP server using the provided credentials.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Specify IMAP URL:**\n",
    "   * `imap_url = 'imap.gmail.com'`: Defines the IMAP server address for Gmail.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Create IMAP4_SSL object:**\n",
    "   * `my_mail = imaplib.IMAP4_SSL(imap_url)`: Creates an IMAP4_SSL object to interact with the specified IMAP server using SSL encryption.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Login to the email account:**\n",
    "   * `my_mail.login(user, password)`: Logs in to the email account using the previously loaded `user` and `password` credentials.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Important Notes:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Security:** Using plain text passwords is generally not recommended for production environments. Consider using encrypted storage or environment variables to protect sensitive information.\n",
    "* **Two-Factor Authentication:** If you have two-factor authentication enabled for your Gmail account, you'll need to generate an app password to use with IMAP.\n",
    "* **Error Handling:** It's essential to implement error handling to catch potential exceptions like connection errors or authentication failures.\n",

    "### Purpose:\n",
    "This code snippet selects the \"Sent Mail\" folder in a Gmail account and fetches a list of email IDs for all emails within that folder.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Breakdown:\n",
    "1. **Selecting the Sent Mail folder:**\n",
    "   * `my_mail.select('\"[Gmail]/Sent Mail\"')`: Selects the \"Sent Mail\" folder in the connected email account. The `select` method returns a tuple containing the status and a list of flags.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Searching for all emails:**\n",
    "   * `_, data = my_mail.search(None, 'ALL')`: Searches for all emails in the currently selected folder. The `search` method returns a tuple containing the status and a list of email IDs. The first element (status) is ignored using `_`, and the second element (data) containing the email IDs is assigned to the `data` variable.\n",
    "   * `mail_ids = data[0].split()`: Converts the list of email IDs (which is a single string) into a list of individual email IDs by splitting it at whitespace characters.\n",

    "### Purpose:\n",
    "This function extracts email addresses from a given text string.\n",

    "### Breakdown:\n",
    "1. **Import Regular Expression Library:**\n",
    "   * `import re`: Imports the `re` module, which provides regular expression functionalities.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Define the Function:**\n",
    "   * `def extract_email_addresses(text):`: Defines a function named `extract_email_addresses` that takes a text string as input.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Regular Expression Pattern:**\n",
    "   * `pattern = r'\\b[A-Za-z0-9._%+-]+@[A-Za-z0-9.-]+\\.[A-Z|a-z]{2,}\\b'`: Defines a regular expression pattern to match email addresses. This pattern is designed to capture email addresses in a standard format.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Finding Email Addresses:**\n",
    "   * `return re.findall(pattern, text)`: Uses the `re.findall` function to find all occurrences of the specified pattern within the input text and returns them as a list of email addresses.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Explanation of the Regular Expression:\n",
    "* `\\b`: Matches a word boundary, ensuring that the email address is a standalone word.\n",
    "* `[A-Za-z0-9._%+-]`: Matches one or more characters from the specified set (letters, numbers, dot, underscore, percent, plus, and hyphen).\n",
    "* `@`: Matches the literal at symbol.\n",
    "* `[A-Za-z0-9.-]+`: Matches one or more characters from the specified set (letters, numbers, dot, and hyphen).\n",
    "* `\\.`: Matches a literal dot.\n",
    "* `[A-Z|a-z]{2,}`: Matches two or more uppercase or lowercase letters (top-level domain).\n",
    "* `\\b`: Matches a word boundary, ensuring the email address ends properly.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Potential Improvements:\n",
    "* **Handle different email formats:** The current pattern might not handle all possible email address formats, such as those with special characters or different top-level domains.\n",
    "* **Validate email addresses:** Consider adding a validation step to verify the extracted email addresses using a more robust email validation library.\n",
    "* **Optimize performance:** For large text inputs, explore optimization techniques like using compiled regular expressions or alternative approaches.\n"

    "\n",
    "### Purpose:\n",
    "Generates a filename with the current date and time in the format \"sent_email_data_YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS.csv\".\n",
    "\n",
    "### Explanation:\n",
    "1. **Import necessary library:**\n",
    "   * `import datetime`: Imports the `datetime` module for working with dates and times.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Get current time:**\n",
    "   * `current_time = datetime.now().strftime(\"%Y%m%d_%H%M%S\")`: Gets the current date and time and formats it as a string in the specified format.\n",
    "     * `datetime.now()`: Gets the current datetime object.\n",
    "     * `strftime(\"%Y%m%d_%H%M%S\")`: Formats the datetime object into a string with the year, month, day, hour, minute, and second separated by underscores.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Create filename:**\n",
    "   * `filename = f\"sent_email_data_{current_time}.csv\"`: Creates the filename by combining the prefix \"sent_email_data_\", the formatted current time, and the \".csv\" extension using f-strings for string interpolation.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example Output:\n",
    "If the code is run at 11:30 AM on April 25, 2024, the `filename` variable will contain the string \"sent_email_data_20240425_113000.csv\".\n",
    "\n",
    "### Additional Considerations:\n",
    "* **Time zone:** If you need to specify a particular time zone, use the `tzinfo` argument in `datetime.now()`.\n",
    "* **File path:** To specify a complete file path, combine the filename with a directory path using `os.path.join`.\n",
    "* **File format:** You can change the file extension (e.g., `.xlsx`, `.json`) to suit your needs.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Would you like to explore any of these options further?** \n"

    "\n",
    "### Purpose:\n",
    "Writes the extracted email data to a CSV file with specified fieldnames.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Explanation:\n",
    "1. **Open CSV file:**\n",
    "   * `with open(filename, 'w', newline='', encoding='utf-8') as csvfile:`: Opens a CSV file for writing in the specified filename with appropriate encoding and newline handling.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Define fieldnames:**\n",
    "   * `fieldnames = ['email', 'name', 'subject']`: Defines the column headers for the CSV file.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Create CSV writer:**\n",
    "   * `writer = csv.DictWriter(csvfile, fieldnames=fieldnames)`: Creates a CSV writer object to write data to the CSV file based on the defined fieldnames.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Write header:**\n",
    "   * `writer.writeheader()`: Writes the header row to the CSV file.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Write data:**\n",
    "   * `for data in email_data:`: Iterates through the list of email data dictionaries.\n",
    "     * `writer.writerow(data)`: Writes each dictionary as a row to the CSV file.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Print confirmation:**\n",
    "   * `print(f\"Email data has been saved to {filename}\")`: Prints a confirmation message indicating the saved file.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Points:\n",
    "* Uses `csv.DictWriter` for efficient writing of dictionary data to CSV.\n",
    "* Specifies `newline=''` to handle potential newline issues.\n",
    "* Includes UTF-8 encoding for handling different character sets.\n",
    "* Writes a header row for better data organization.\n"

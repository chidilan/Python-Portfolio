    "This Python script helps identify district names that are present in one Excel sheet but missing from another, even if there are slight variations in their spelling. It uses fuzzy matching techniques to account for these discrepancies.\n",
    "\n",
    "-----\n",
    "\n",
    "### Functions\n",
    "\n",
    "The script consists of three main functions:\n",
    "\n",
    "  * **`clean_district_name(name)`**:\n",
    "\n",
    "      * **Purpose**: This function takes a district name (string) as input and cleans it by:\n",
    "          * Converting it to lowercase.\n",
    "          * Removing common prefixes like \"Dr.\", \"Shri\", \"Saint\", \"St.\", and \"District\".\n",
    "          * Eliminating special characters and extra spaces.\n",
    "      * **Returns**: A cleaned, standardized version of the district name.\n",
    "\n",
    "  * **`are_districts_similar(dist1, dist2, threshold=80)`**:\n",
    "\n",
    "      * **Purpose**: This function compares two district names for similarity using various fuzzy matching algorithms from the `fuzzywuzzy` library.\n",
    "      * **Parameters**:\n",
    "          * `dist1`, `dist2`: The two district names to compare.\n",
    "          * `threshold`: An integer (defaulting to 80) representing the minimum similarity score required for two names to be considered a match.\n",
    "      * **How it works**: It applies several fuzzy matching ratios (ratio, partial ratio, token sort ratio, token set ratio) and returns `True` if any of them meet or exceed the specified `threshold`. It also returns `True` for an exact match after cleaning.\n",
    "      * **Returns**: `True` if the districts are considered similar, `False` otherwise.\n",
    "\n",
    "  * **`find_missing_districts(file_path, sheet1_name='Sheet1', sheet2_name='Sheet2')`**:\n",
    "\n",
    "      * **Purpose**: This is the core function that orchestrates the comparison between two Excel sheets to find missing districts.\n",
    "      * **Parameters**:\n",
    "          * `file_path`: The full path to your Excel file.\n",
    "          * `sheet1_name`: The name of the first sheet (default is 'Sheet1').\n",
    "          * `sheet2_name`: The name of the second sheet (default is 'Sheet2').\n",
    "      * **Process**:\n",
    "        1.  Reads data from both specified sheets into pandas DataFrames.\n",
    "        2.  Iterates through each row in the **first sheet (`sheet1_name`)**.\n",
    "        3.  For each district in `sheet1_name`, it filters the districts in `sheet2_name` to only consider those belonging to the **same state**.\n",
    "        4.  It then uses `are_districts_similar` to check if the `sheet1_name` district has a fuzzy match within the corresponding state's districts in `sheet2_name`.\n",
    "        5.  If no similar district is found, the district from `sheet1_name` (along with its state) is added to a list of missing districts.\n",
    "        6.  Finally, it converts the list of missing districts into a pandas DataFrame and saves it as a new Excel file on your **desktop**. The output file name includes a timestamp for uniqueness (e.g., `missing_districts_YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS.xlsx`).\n",
    "      * **Returns**: A pandas DataFrame containing the list of districts found in `sheet1_name` but not in `sheet2_name`.\n",
    "\n",
    "-----\n",
    "\n",
    "### How to Use\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  **Save the code**: Save the provided code as a Python file (e.g., `district_checker.py`).\n",
    "2.  **Install libraries**: Ensure you have the necessary libraries installed. If not, open your terminal or command prompt and run:\n",
    "    ```bash\n",
    "    pip install pandas openpyxl fuzzywuzzy python-Levenshtein\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "    (Note: `python-Levenshtein` is a C implementation that speeds up `fuzzywuzzy`.)\n",
    "3.  **Prepare your Excel file**: Your Excel file should contain at least two sheets, each with columns named **'State'** and **'District'**.\n",
    "4.  **Run the script**: Execute the Python script from your terminal:\n",
    "    ```bash\n",
    "    python district_checker.py\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "5.  **Provide inputs**: The script will prompt you to:\n",
    "      * Enter the full path to your Excel file.\n",
    "      * Optionally, enter the names of the first and second sheets you want to compare (press Enter to use the default 'Sheet1' and 'Sheet2').\n",
    "\n",
    "-----\n",
    "\n",
    "### Output\n",
    "\n",
    "The script will print:\n",
    "\n",
    "  * The total number of missing districts found.\n",
    "  * The path where the results Excel file has been saved on your desktop.\n",
    "  * The first few rows of the DataFrame containing the missing districts directly in your console.\n",
    "\n",
    "A new Excel file (e.g., `missing_districts_20250629_152039.xlsx`) will be created on your desktop, listing the states and districts that were found in the first sheet but not in the second (based on the fuzzy matching logic)."

    "\n",
    "-----\n",
    "\n",
    "### How to Use\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  **Dependencies**: Ensure you have the necessary Python libraries installed. If not, open your terminal or command prompt and run:\n",
    "\n",
    "    ```bash\n",
    "    pip install pandas openpyxl fuzzywuzzy python-Levenshtein\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "\n",
    "    (`python-Levenshtein` is highly recommended for performance with `fuzzywuzzy`.)\n",
    "\n",
    "2.  **Excel File Structure**: Your Excel file (`Kill me.xlsx` in the example) must contain at least two sheets, named 'RTO' and 'Dealer Master' (or whatever you specify for `sheet1_name` and `sheet2_name`). Both sheets must have columns titled 'State' and 'District'.\n",
    "\n",
    "3.  **Update File Path**: Before running, **modify the `excel_file` variable** in the `if __name__ == \"__main__\":` block to the exact path of your Excel file:\n",
    "\n",
    "    ```python\n",
    "    excel_file = r\"C:\\Users\\ASUS\\Downloads\\Kill me.xlsx\" # Make sure this path is correct\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "\n",
    "      * **Note**: Using an `r` prefix before the string (raw string) handles backslashes correctly in Windows file paths.\n",
    "\n",
    "4.  **Adjust Threshold (Optional)**: You can modify the `similarity_threshold` variable (default is 80) to control how strict or lenient the fuzzy matching should be. A higher number (e.g., 90-100) means a closer match is required, while a lower number (e.g., 60-70) will find more loosely related names.\n",
    "\n",
    "5.  **Run the Script**: Execute the Python script from your terminal:\n",
    "\n",
    "    ```bash\n",
    "    python your_script_name.py\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "\n",
    "    (Replace `your_script_name.py` with the actual name you saved the file as.)\n",
    "\n",
    "-----\n",
    "\n",
    "### Output\n",
    "\n",
    "Upon execution, the script will:\n",
    "\n",
    "  * Print messages to the console indicating how many missing districts were found and the full path to the generated output file on your desktop.\n",
    "  * If missing districts are found, it will also print the head (first few rows) of the DataFrame containing these missing districts directly to the console.\n",
    "  * An Excel file, named similar to `missing_dealer_master_districts_YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS.xlsx`, will be created in your operating system's desktop directory. This file will contain two columns: 'State' and 'Missing District (from Dealer Master)', listing all the districts identified as missing from the 'RTO' sheet based on the fuzzy matching criteria."
